**Graph I am trying to replicate:**

## Importing Data

Upload raw data to R and install/load packages required to clean data.

```{r}
#install.packages('dslabs')
#install.packages('tidyverse')
#install.packages('here')
#install.packages('rjson')
#install.packages('plotly')
#install.packages('ggthemes')
library(tidyverse)
library(dslabs)
library(here)
library(plotly)
library(ggthemes)

#import file via relative path
#raw_bothsexes <- read_csv(here('Visualization_Exercise/raw_data/both_sexes.csv'))
raw_divorce <- read_csv(here('Visualization_Exercise/raw_data/divorce.csv'))
#raw_men <- read_csv(here('Visualization_Exercise/raw_data/men.csv'))
#raw_women <- read_csv(here('Visualization_Exercise/raw_data/women.csv'))

tibble(raw_bothsexes)
tibble(raw_divorce)

```

## Cleaning data to build the: "Divorce Rates by Education"

Variables will be:

### Highschool or Less

`HS` \| High school graduate or less (EDUCD \< 65)

### Some college

`SC` \| Some college (EDUCD \>= 65 & \<= 100)

### College graduate

`BAp` \| Bachelor's degree or more (EDUCD \> 100) `BAo` \| Bachelor's degree, no graduate degre (EDUCD \> 100 & \<= 113) `GD` \| Graduate degree (EDUCD \> 113)

**Goal is to have an X- Axis of "Year (Decade)" and a Y-Axis of "% of Divorce with Education" of only ages 35 to 44**

```{r}
clean_Div <- raw_divorce %>%
  select('year', 'HS_3544', 'SC_3544', 'BAp_3544', 'BAo_3544', 'GD_3544')
  
clean_Div$Graduate <- rowMeans(clean_Div[, c(3:5)], na.rm=TRUE)
#I made the exective decision to get an average of this data because this would be what would me most reminiscent of the original graph. It looks exactly the same as there's after visualization.

clean_Div <- rename(clean_Div, SomeCollege = SC_3544)
clean_Div <- rename(clean_Div, Highschool = HS_3544)
clean_Div <- rename(clean_Div, Year = year)

Div_3345 <- clean_Div %>%
  select('Year','Highschool', 'SomeCollege', 'Graduate')

```

## Start Plotting

```{r}
main <- ggplot(data = Div_3345) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Highschool), color = 'lightblue3', size=1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = Graduate), color = "paleturquoise", size=1.5) +
  geom_line(aes(x = Year, y = SomeCollege), color = '#336699', size=1.5) +
  xlab("") + 
  ylab("") +
  ggtitle("Divorce Rates By Education", subtitle = "Ages 35 to 44") +
  scale_color_fivethirtyeight() +
  theme_fivethirtyeight(base_size = 18, base_family = "sans") +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1)) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=1995, y=.2, label="Some College", colour="#336699",
             size=6, family="sans", fontface="bold", angle=0) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=2000, y=.15, label="High school or less", colour="lightblue3",
             size=6, family="sans", fontface="bold", angle=0) +
  annotate(geom="text", x=2005, y=.12, label="College graduates", colour="paleturquoise",
             size=6, family="sans", fontface="bold", angle=0)

#My biggest issue with this graph is I cannot figure out how they added the labels for each education level with black with lines pointing to each trendline. Is it possible that they did this in lightroom after? To compensate, I made the labels "float" near the lines and made their color match.

main

##ggthemes had a theme called 'fivethirtyeight' that was very close to what is seen in the original plot. It was found here: https://yutannihilation.github.io/allYourFigureAreBelongToUs/ggthemes/theme_fivethirtyeight/
```

## Explore Plotly

```{r}
ggplotly(maintooltip = c("text"))

two <- plotly_build(main)

names(two$x$data[[1]])
names(two$x$layout)

#I am having trouble editing the layout of plotly. The github and help pages have not been very helpful.

```
